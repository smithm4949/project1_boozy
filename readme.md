# ConCocktail

## Project status
ConCocktail application is [LIVE](https://smithm4949.github.io/project1_boozy/). There are currently no plans for further development.

## Description

This application will generate cocktail options when a user inputs any type of ingredients. The application will also provide total calories for a chosen drink and the application will tell you how to burn the calories. Lastly, the application has random jokes and fun facts.

There are 5 APIs utilized in the application. Please see Technologies Used section below for urls.

### Usage
Do you want to order a drink but you don't know the name of drinks? Are you boring and need some fun facts and jokes to help you be cooler? Are you going on a date and you need a "Hitch" friend to help you with all the above?

We got you! This application will be your most important bar asset.

## User Story

AS someone looking for a good night but nervous about drinks, bars, or socializing
I want to see a list of cocktails that use certain ingredients
SO that I feel prepared and confident with a drink recommendation and ice breakers
