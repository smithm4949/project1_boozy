## Description

This application will generate cocktail options when a user inputs any type of ingredients. The application will also provide total calories for a chosen drink and the application will tell you how to burn the calories. Lastly, the application has random jokes and fun facts.

### Usage
Do you want to order a drink but you don't know the name of drinks? Are you boring and need some fun facts and jokes to help you be cooler? Are you going on a date and you need a "Hitch" friend to help you with all the above?
